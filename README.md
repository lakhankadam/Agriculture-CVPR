Machine Learning Models for Agriculture Vision Dataset
CVPR 2021 Challenge on Agriculture Vision
This repo contains the code to reproduce our results in the CVPR21 Challenge on Agriculture-Vision. 
The first model is modified MSCG-Net. The second model is modified DeepLabv3, please see Deeplabv3_Ensemble/Readme.txt to train and test the model.
The results of the above models are assembled together to improve the overall mIoU using the ensemble code in Deeplabv3_Ensemble.
